# next-shopify-app
embedded app built with next.js and custom koa server.

_app is a next.js thing that wraps the app just FYI

If you attempt to install this in your dev store - know that the "simple resource list" is currently loading the index.js route and the other two tabs do not have views as there's no designs for them yet.
